{"name":"MIPS Simulator","tagline":"Simulation (with pipelining) of a MIPS R4000 CPU in Python","body":"### Welcome to the MIPS Simulator Project Site\r\nThis project was developed during my academic work at the University of Kansas School of Engineering.  It is intended to demonstrate how a pipelined CPU might be simulated in code.  The project was written in Python.\r\n\r\n### How to Use This Program\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### A Bit of a Warning\r\nPlease note that while this code is fork or be used elsewhere, it was submitted for grading by my instructor and is possibly still on file with the university.  You are free to refer to this code to help you get started if you are working on a similar assignment, but you are hereby warned that if you should attempt to copy substantial portions of this code to use in your project, it will likely result in your being cited for academic misconduct with all the associated consequences to follow.  The purpose of my posting this code is instructive in nature, not as a cheating tool.  I leave it to you to decide how to best approach that issue.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2013 @jtanzi\r\nYou can see some more of my work at GitHub by clicking the link provided just above this line. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
